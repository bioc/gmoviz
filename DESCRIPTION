Description: Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and cell lines are widely 
    used models in all kinds of biological research. As part of characterising
    these models, DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses are 
    used systematically to study their genomes. Therefore, large volumes of 
    data are generated and various algorithms are applied to analyse this data, 
    which introduces a challenge on representing all findings in an informative
    and concise manner. `gmoviz` provides users with an easy way to visualise 
    and facilitate the explanation of complex genomic editing events on a 
    larger, biologically-relevant scale.
