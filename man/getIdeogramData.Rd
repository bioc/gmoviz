\title{Import transgenic genome data from .bam or .fasta file}
\usage{
getIdeogramData(bam_file = NULL, fasta_file = NULL,
  fasta_folder = NULL, just_pattern = NULL, unwanted_chr = NULL,
  wanted_chr = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam_file, fasta_file, fasta_folder}{Location of either a .bam file,
.fasta file or folder of .fasta files to read in. You only need to supply
one of these file types; .bam files are recommended because it is much
faster than using .fasta files. Also note that the filters
\code{unwatedChr}, \code{wanted_chr} and \code{just_pattern} won't work with
single .fasta files (only with .bam or .fasta folders).}

\item{just_pattern}{If supplied, this pattern (regex) will be used to select
the sequences to read in}

\item{unwanted_chr}{If supplied, these sequences won't be read in}

\item{wanted_chr}{If supplied, only these sequences will be read in}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{GRanges} containing the ideogram data (sequence
names, starts & ends).
}
\description{
Read in the seqname, start & end from .bam or .fasta file and
format correctly for plotting with gmoviz.
}
\examples{
## the example .bam file
path <- system.file("extdata", "ex1.bam", package="Rsamtools")

## just starting with "seq"
getIdeogramData(bam_file=path, just_pattern="^seq")

## only seq1
getIdeogramData(bam_file=path, wanted_chr="seq1")

## not seq2 (same as above)
getIdeogramData(bam_file=path, unwanted_chr="seq2")

## you can mix and match any of the filters
getIdeogramData(bam_file=path, unwanted_chr="seq2", just_pattern="^seq")

## the function also works to read in individual .fasta files, but please
## note that for now the filters won't work (so if you have multiple
## sequences in one .fasta file then they will all be read in)
path <- system.file("extdata", "someORF.fa", package="Biostrings")
getIdeogramData(fasta_file=path)

## we can also read in selected .fasta files from a folder of .fasta files,
## based on the filters shown above for the .bam file
path <- system.file("extdata", "fastaFolder", package="gmoviz")
getIdeogramData(fasta_folder=path)
}
